# The Fourier Transform: Create mesmerizing animations from simple images.

The Fourier transform has many useful applications across an array of fields, from heat transfer all the way down to quantum mechanics, and though useful, it also forms approximations which can appear quite elegant.
Through the use of a Fourier approximation, as well as some interesting methods from machine learning and image processing, the function provided in this repository allows a user to take a simple image, like this silhouette of a deer:

and convert it into an animation like so:
